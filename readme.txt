Shu Y, Yu YG, Yang, J. and McCormick DA Selective control of cortical
axonal action potentials by a slowly inactivating K+ current.
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 27:
11453-11458, (2007).

A simple model of a soma and axon was constructed by using Neuron.

The soma had a diameter and length of 20 mm (1 compartment) and
contained a leak conductance (reversal potential -70 mV) Rm = 30,000
Ohm/cm2 with membrane capacitance Cm = 0.75 mF/cm2.

The axon had a diameter of 1 mm and a length of between 20 and 200 mm,
with the later containing 10 compartments. In the axon, the leak
conductance Rm = 125,000 Ohm/cm2, and the membrane capacitance Cm =
0.75 mF/cm2. The axonal axial resistance was 150 W-cm.

Kv1.2 current exists in axon initial segment, which play important
roles in modulating spike duration and threshold of action potentials.

Running Neuron_Dcurrent.hoc, then analyze the output data file
soma_axon_id.dat to see D current effect on action potentials
